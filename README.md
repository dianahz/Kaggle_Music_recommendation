Description/Motivation:

To build a music recommendation system 

Background:

Musical gatekeepers have been replaced with personalizing algorithms and unlimited streaming services. While the public’s now listening to all kinds of music, algorithms still struggle in key areas. Without enough historical data, how would an algorithm know if listeners will like a new song or a new artist? And, how would it know what songs to recommend brand new users? WSDM has challenged the Kaggle ML community to help solve these problems and build a better music recommendation system. 

Data:

The dataset is from KKBOX, Asia’s leading music streaming service, holding the world’s most comprehensive Asia-Pop music library with over 30 million tracks. They currently use a collaborative filtering based algorithm with matrix factorization and word embedding in their recommendation system but believe new techniques could lead to better results.
